# Primer: No-Hangman

At the end of the two-weeks primer course on SQL, Tableau and Python, everybody builds a simple text-based Hangman game hosted on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com). This project has the following learning objectives:

- Python data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets)
- Python control structures (if, for, while)

We also start to learn how to use Google Colab for coding and sharing code.
