In the exercises below you will need to use the following clauses:
    - GROUP BY
    - HAVING

    publisher has. */

/* 
The main difference between WHERE and HAVING is that:
    - the WHERE clause is used to specify a condition for filtering most records
    - the HAVING clause is used to specify a condition for filtering values from 
      an aggregate (such as MAX(), AVG(), COUNT() etc...)

/*
BONUS MATERIAL!!


You may have noticed in Exercise 10 that we get the same result if we group by 
city alone, we get the same result as grouping by city and state together!

Why? Each city has a unique name in the database. Let's add an author in a
city with a name we've seen before, but in a different state.

we have two authors in San Jose, but one in California and one in Illinois! 

Now let's remove this author to avoid inconsistencies later.
