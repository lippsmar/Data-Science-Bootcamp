# Supervised Machine Learning

## Project Overview 📊

In this chapter, we'll dive into Supervised Machine Learning with a focus on predicting housing prices. We'll start with the basics of machine learning, and then progress through various phases and concepts necessary for building effective models.

## Data Preparation 🧹

The data preparation phase involves several crucial steps to ensure that the dataset is ready for modeling. Key tasks include:
- **Handling Missing Values:** Address any missing data to avoid errors during model training.
- **Categorical Encoding:** Convert categorical variables into a numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding or ordinal encoding.
- **Data Scaling:** Normalize or standardize features to ensure they are on a similar scale.
- **Feature Selection:** Choose the most relevant features that contribute to model performance.

## Feature Engineering 🔧

Feature engineering involves creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve the model's performance. This step often includes:
- **Creating Interaction Features:** Combine existing features to capture interactions between them.
- **Polynomial Features:** Generate polynomial and interaction features for non-linear relationships.
- **Feature Extraction:** Use methods like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce dimensionality while preserving variance.

## Clustering Analysis 🔍

Before moving to regression, clustering analysis can be used to group similar houses based on features. This phase includes:
- **Choosing the Number of Clusters:** Use methods like the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- **Analyzing Clusters:** Examine the characteristics of each cluster to understand underlying patterns.

## PCA (Principal Component Analysis) 📉

PCA is a technique used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining most of the variance. Key steps include:
- **Standardizing the Data:** Ensure that features have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.
- **Computing Principal Components:** Identify the principal components that capture the most variance.
- **Transforming Data:** Project the data onto the principal components to reduce dimensionality.

## Regression 🏗

In the second phase of the project, we'll build a regression model to predict the exact price of a house. This involves:
- **Regression Models 📚:** Understand different regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, KNN) and their suitability for predicting continuous values.
- **Regression Performance Metrics 📊:** Learn how to evaluate regression models using metrics such as:
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Measures the average magnitude of errors in predictions.
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Emphasizes larger errors by squaring the differences.
  - **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE):** Provides error metrics relative to the actual values.
  - **R Squared (R²):** Indicates how well the model explains the variance in the target variable.

## Feature Selection: Correlation Matrix 📈

Feature selection is essential for improving model performance and interpretability. Key concepts include:
- **Correlation Coefficient:** Measures the strength and direction of the relationship between variables.
- **Correlation Matrix:** Visualize correlations between features to identify redundant or collinear features.
- **Dropping Highly Correlated Features:** Remove features that are highly correlated to avoid multicollinearity and improve model performance.
