# Chapter 2: Introduction to pandas

The topics of our second bootcamp week for learning
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) were:

- data import
- filtering
- aggregation
- string filtering including regexps
- range and set filtering
- grouping
- joins/merges
- plotting

and two more general topics:

- functions
- error handling and debugging techniques

For this, we were primarily using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), VSCode and [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)/[Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/).
