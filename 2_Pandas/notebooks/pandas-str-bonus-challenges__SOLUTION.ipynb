For example, a transmission named \"Automatic 4-spd\" has 4 speeds, and one named \"Auto (AM6)\" has 6 speeds.

Regular expressions are sequences of characters designed to match patterns. They can become really complex (to match complex patterns), but for this case, a simple [5 minute tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQQsYXa1EHs&ab_channel=Kite) or some googling should be enough.
