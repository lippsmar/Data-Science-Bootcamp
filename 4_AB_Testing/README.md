# A/B Testing for Eniac's Website 🛒📊

## Project Overview 🚀

In this project, we worked on optimizing **Eniac's landing page** by experimenting with various designs of the "SHOP NOW" button. The goal was to improve conversion rates (specifically Click-Through Rates, or CTR) for users interested in purchasing the iPhone 13. We focused on the top of the **purchase funnel**, aiming to increase conversions from site visits to clicks on the "SHOP NOW" button.

### The Experiment ⚙️

We tested four different versions of the "SHOP NOW" button:

- **Version A**: The original design.
- **Version B**: Changed the button color to red.
- **Version C**: Updated the button text to "SEE DEALS."
- **Version D**: Combined the changes from Version B and C (red button with "SEE DEALS").

Each version was shown to a different group of users, and the goal was to determine which version maximized the number of clicks, driving users deeper into the **sales funnel**.

### Key Metrics 📈

The primary metric we used was the **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**, defined as:

$$
\text{CTR} = \frac{\text{Number of Clicks}}{\text{Total Visits}}
$$

We also looked at conversion rates across the entire funnel to understand where users were dropping off and to ensure the changes had a positive impact on the overall sales process.

### Tools & Techniques 🔧

- **A/B Testing Design**: Set up and analyzed multiple variations of the "SHOP NOW" button.
- **Chi-Square Test**: Used to determine whether the differences in clicks across versions were statistically significant.
- **Bonferroni Adjustment**: Applied to correct for multiple comparisons when analyzing post-hoc tests.
- **Data Visualization**: Created funnel visualizations to track conversions across the purchase steps.
  
### Results & Findings 🏆

Through rigorous testing and analysis, we identified the version that significantly improved user engagement with the "SHOP NOW" button. The most successful version led to a higher CTR, with a marked increase in users progressing down the funnel, ultimately boosting sales of the iPhone 13.
