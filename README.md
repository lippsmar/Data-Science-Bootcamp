its business to Brazil and evaluates the potential after-sales fulfillment partner
Magist for its suitability.

## Chapter 5: Data Pipelines on the Cloud

In this two-week project, we learned and exercised ETL data-engineering skills, i.e. extracting, transforming and loading data into storage for comprehensive analysis. We scraped the web, used public APIs, transformed and augmented the data and stored it in an SQL database. The finished ETL process was then wrapped into a Google cloud function for automatic execution.
