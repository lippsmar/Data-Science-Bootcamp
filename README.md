## Primer: Hangman

At the end of the two-weeks primer course on SQL, Tableau, and Python, everybody builds a simple text-based [Hangman](<0_Hangman_game_with_Python>).

## Chapter 1: Eniac expansion from Spain to Brazil

In this [case study](<1_Data Driven Businesses with SQL & Tableau>), the company Eniac wants to expand its business to Brazil and evaluates the potential after-sales fulfillment partner Magist for its suitability.

## Chapter 2: Introduction to pandas

As the second basic data-handling system after SQL, we were introduced to the Python [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library. Read about our challenges [here](<2_Pandas>)!

## Chapter 3: Data Cleaning and Storytelling

The skills we learned in this chapter include Data Cleaning, Data Visualization & Data Storytelling. We explored Seaborn, Matplotlib, and dived deeper into Pandas. Check out more details about our tasks [here](<3_Data Storytelling & Data Cleaning>)!

## Chapter 4: A/B Testing

This chapter introduces the concept of A/B testing, a crucial method in experimentation and decision-making in data science. We explored how to design an A/B test, evaluate metrics, and analyze the results for actionable insights, focusing on statistical rigor and business impact. Learn more about the structured approach to A/B testing [here](<4_AB_Testing>).

## Chapter 5: Data Pipelines on the Cloud

In this two-week project, we learned and exercised ETL data-engineering skills, i.e. extracting, transforming, and loading data into storage for comprehensive analysis. We scraped the web, used public APIs, transformed and augmented the data, and stored it in an SQL database. The finished ETL process was then wrapped into a Google cloud function for automatic execution. I wrote my first [Medium article](<https://medium.com/@spceng/my-first-data-engineering-project-data-pipelines-in-action-for-gans-acfa7b3641cc>) about this project.

## Chapter 6: Supervised Machine Learning

In this chapter, we focused on supervised machine learning methods by developing a housing price prediction model. This involved exploring regression models, feature selection, and data preprocessing techniques. We discussed the importance of understanding the problem domain and creating robust models that generalize well on unseen data. Check out more [here](<6_Supervised_Machine_Learning>).

## Chapter 7: Generative AI

The focus of this chapter was on building a chatbot using Large Language Models (LLMs) and transformers to solve real-world problems. We explored generative models and their applications in dialogue systems, fine-tuning and customization of LLMs, and deploying AI solutions as interactive tools. Read more about the cutting-edge techniques [here](<7_Generative_AI>).
